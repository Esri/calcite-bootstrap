## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Bug where the ".btn-default" elements' ":active" styling is applied to its active children instead of itself.

##v0.3.0
### Changed
- Lots of style changes to the navbar. Default height is now 65px, up from 50px. On hover the accent bar is now below the link instead of above. Tightened up the padding and margin on links significantly. This also makes the accent bar only the width of the text above it. Added custom rule for padding on the active links.

- Added new styling for having icons within form controls. Removed box-shadow from normal form-control states.
- Removed media-query in navbar-custom to reduce font-size at small viewports.
- Styling changes to Calcite-Header include changing background colors for tab and tab hover, adding spacing between tabs, color of hover accent bar
- Fixed compile issue in loader.scss where avenir-regular could not be extended
