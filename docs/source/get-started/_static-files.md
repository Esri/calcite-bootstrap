This is probably the easiest way, but you won't get any of the helpful Sass mixins and you will have to manually keep your project in sync with Calcite+Bootstrap. However, if you're looking to get up and running quickly, just [download the latest release](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-bootstrap/releases) and move the zipped files to wherever you keep your assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).

Calcite+Bootstrap releases include the combined and minified bootstrap javascript files in the `/dist/js` folder. If you have a javascript build system, you can include a step to merge this file with your other scripts. Or you can create a task to simply copy this file into your project's javascript folder. We recommend you automate this instead of manually copying the file so that if/when you upgrade Calcite+Bootstrap, this file will also be upgraded at the same time.

**Note**: The bootstrap javascript files depend on jquery being loaded into the page. We recommend pulling this from the Google CDN.
