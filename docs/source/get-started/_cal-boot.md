**Calcite** is a flexible design framework, created at ESRI, in which the map and data are the most important component of the user interface. All elements and interactions strengthen a geo-centered user experience.

**Calcite Bootstrap** is a UI Kit built on the popular [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) CSS framework based on the Calcite design framework.

We have applied the robust set of patterns and utilities that are core to the Calcite framework to Calcite Bootstrap. The purpose is to have designs be consistent, but also embrace the characteristics that make each medium unique.

Calcite Bootstrap was built *for* developers who have experience working with Bootstrap markup and classes.
